<p style="font-family:arial">Why I choose this because like what i said earlier in the previous korean dramas is all about connected in real world there's no imaginary happen in life. Queen of Tears is one of these dramas. There were so many people talking about it, and it’s probably because I know a ton of Kim Soo-hyun fans. Every time a drama or movie comes out with him, all of the girlies go on and on about how it’s the next best thing, even when it’s vaguely mediocre in my mind after watching. Power to them though.</p>
